1. Import the Titanic Dataset from the link Titanic Data Set.
Perform the following:
a. Preprocess the passenger names to come up with a list of titles that represent families
and represent using appropriate visualization graph.
# Load packages
library('ggplot2') # visualization
library('ggthemes') # visualization
library('scales') # visualization
library('dplyr') # data manipulation
library('mice') # imputation
library('randomForest') # classification algorithm
train <- read.csv('../input/train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
test  <- read.csv('../input/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)

full  <- bind_rows(train, test) # bind training & test data

# check data
str(full)
# Grab title from passenger names
full$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', full$Name)
# Show title counts by sex again
table(full$Sex, full$Title)
# Finally, grab surname from passenger name
full$Surname <- sapply(full$Name,  
                      function(x) strsplit(x, split = '[,.]')[[1]][1])
cat(paste('We have <b>', nlevels(factor(full$Surname)), '</b> unique surnames. I would be interested to infer ethnicity based on surname --- another time.'))

b. Represent the proportion of people survived from the family size using a graph.
setwd("C:/Users/sriram.sampath/Desktop/Kaggle/Titanic")
train <- read.csv("train.csv")
colnames(train)
table(train$Survived)
table(train$Pclass)
train$Pclass <- as.factor(train$Pclass) table(train$Pclass,train$Survived)
train$Survived <- as.factor(train$Survived) plot(train$Pclass,train$Survived)
train$Sex <- as.factor(train$Sex) table(train$Sex)
table(train$Sex, train$Survived)
plot(train$Sex, train$Survived)
c. Impute the missing values in Age variable using Mice Library, create two different
graphs showing Age distribution before and after imputation.
library(Amelia)
library(mice)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
train_raw <- read.csv('../input/train.csv')
train_raw$MSSubClass <- as.factor(train_raw$MSSubClass)
train_raw$MoSold <- as.factor(train_raw$MoSold)
train_raw$YrSold <- as.factor(train_raw$YrSold)
missmap(train_raw[-1], col=c('grey', 'steelblue'), y.cex=0.5, x.cex=0.8)
 
# Let's also get some hard numbers
sort(sapply(train_raw, function(x) { sum(is.na(x)) }), decreasing=TRUE)
